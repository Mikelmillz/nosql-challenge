Luckily I remember how to code the top so that I can load mango without having to pull it up in the prompt. Lesson 12.2 activity 3 let me print showed me what do code for part 1. The next part is why I should read the module lesson instead of just trying to jump in. I printed a find_one so that I would have all the fields, then I made up the data, only to realize later that the code wanted was given. Insert_one is found in lesson 12.2 activity 1 as well as update_one. Count_doc is in lesson 12.2 activity 5 and delete_many is found in activity 3 as well. I used 12.2 activity 6 to help with changing using update_many. Then for the last part I used this website: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70329485/how-can-i-change-the-string-data-type-to-int-massively-in-mongodb to make ratingvalue an integer.

For the analysis part it was much the same in the beginning. For finding things in this database are lesson 12.2 activity 8 and 12.3 activity 3 which honestly was the rest of the homework assignment.

I do have to say though, having to load Mongo was a pain between two pandas. I kept trying to load the data in, only to get two sets of data. You live and you learn.
